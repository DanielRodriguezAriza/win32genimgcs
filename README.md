# win32genimgcs
A simple quick and dirty C# program to generate images using win32's System.Drawing.

Obviously, this project is Windows-only due to its usage of System.Drawing, which is pretty much just a light C# wrapper around the WIN32 image creation functionality.

The main purpose of this project was for me to create .ico images quickly under a Windows 10 machine, so it's a pretty simple program that I quickly threw together, so take it more as a one-off script if anything.
